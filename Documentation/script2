Hello,
In this video I am going to show you how to get our project up and running. 
So, so to get started with the project you need to setup each component according to steps I descrie now.

First, we get started with configuring R-Pi, the key component.
For this you should have your machine connected on same WiFi as the R-Pi and know it's IP address. We have a link to find that in desciption of the video.  In my case the IP is *.*.*.* 
Now ssh into R-Pi using 
'ssh pi@...'

I have placed the code in ~/Desktop/project/rpi-rc522-read-only/rc522/smart_kitchen

So cd in that folder and run
'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
